# agent-orchestration.md — Deprecated

## Status

This file is deprecated and retained only as a historical note.
Do not treat it as a normative management document.

## Active Governance Sources

## Current Governance Model

- Management must be LLM-agnostic: Claude/Codex/Gemini all follow the same governance.
- Codex-specific instructions are supplemental and must not create a separate management system.
- Issue-Centric workflow is mandatory across all agents.
- Quality gates, branch flow, and visual-check gate must follow the active sources listed above.

## Migration Note
